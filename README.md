My cozy website made using Rust as a preprocessor for the HTML!

**Why did I do this?** Well, initially I wanted to make a website that used Rust with Wasm to make it dynamic, but after thinking this through and through, I realized, I do not need it to be dynamic, I just need it to be functional. So I decided to make a preprocessor since the website is still quite advanced and requires a lot of repetition, all it does is abstract the tedious repetition into what I call .sdo files (Silly Data Objects).

**When will I add real content to the windows?** Someday, when I feel like it I will probably add a few windows about my projects and all that, for now it will just have the template windows.
