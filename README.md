# stellarst0rm.github.io
Remake of my website, using Rust!

## TODO
- Port old website's code to the new one
- Change style? (A more unique style, as opposed to the old GNOME-like style)

## NAQ (Never Asked Questions):
**Why?**
Because i feel like it, and it's better than JavaScript. (Anything is better than JavaScript)
<br>**How?**
With Wasm!
<br>**When?**
Today.
<br>**Where?**
Here?

## How to run locally (Why tho?)
Clone the repo and run the build script with the `run` flag!
<br>Like this: `sh build.sh run`

(This will build the DEV version, to build the PROD version use: `BUILD_ENV="PROD" sh build.sh run`)

### You must have:
- rustup (Duh)
- wasm-pack (`cargo install wasm-pack`)
- python3 (To run the website)
